# README
If you are looking for the build guide to the original OpenCTD created by OceanographyForEveryone, [it can be found here](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD).

The CTDizzle and OpenCTD have a lot in common, and some of the information is shared between the two GitHub accounts. However, you should check here first for updates on the CTDizzle.


## CTDizzle
![CTDizzle](https://github.com/CTDizzle/CTDizzle/blob/master/Documentation/Images/Finished.jpg)

This repository contains the code, resources, and build guide used to build the CTDizzle based around the Arduino MKRZero.
You can also find the legacy build guide for the Qduino version, but no additional updates will be made in the future. If you have questions about the Qduino build, feel free to email Ian Black (blackia@oregonstate.edu).

To get started, navigate to Documentation > MKRZero > User Guide
