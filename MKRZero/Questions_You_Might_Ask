# Questions You Might Ask

### 1. The TSYS01 temperature sensor is much more expensive than the DS18B20 sensor. Why the switch?

The TSYS01 temperature sensor boasts a much smaller deviation in temperature accuracy than the DS18B20. (0.1 degC vs 0.5 degC). Temperature plays a significant role in conductivity, salinity, density, and sound velocity calculations.
A more accurate sensor give much better end result data.


### 2. Why is the device cylindrical instead of spherical or rectangular?

The CTD is going to depths where pressure is roughly 200 psi. This pressure is experienced from all directions. The optimal shape for a pressure case would be spherical, but it is often difficult to fabricate spheres, so the next best option is to use a cylindrical case.
If you have a spherical and a cylindrical case with the same wall thickness, the cylinder will typically have half the strength as the sphere. Cylindrical pressure cases are typically closed off by hemispherical (rounded) or torispherical (flat) end caps. 

Rectangular pressure cases, while much easier to manufacture, can't really withstand pressure as well as cylindrical cases. There are more failure points and the odd shape of the O-Rings increases the potential of more leak points. Force is being exerted on the pressure case in all directions, and with a rectangular case, there are more points where the case can fail as some areas are not as well supported (think corners vs. walls).


### 3. What is the purpose of the O-ring?

When compressed, the O-ring will fill in gaps that water can leak through. It is important to make sure the O-rings are clean and free of of damage.


### 4. Why did you switch from the Qduino Mini to the MKRZero?

The MKRZero boasts a much larger memory than the Qduino Mini. This allows for the microcontroller to compute salinity, depth, density, and sound velocity on the fly, instead of having to run the data through a processing program at a later time.
A downside of the MKRZero is that the LEDs don't light up when on battery power, and there is no support for battery charge monitoring.
